# How to create a 3D Pie chart

The following example demonstrates how to create a [3D Pie](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/2963/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/series-views/3d-series-views/pie-and-donut-series-views/pie-chart?p=netframework) chart at runtime.

Note that this series view type is associated with the [Simple Diagram 3D](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5911/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram/simple-diagram-3d?p=netframework) type, and you should cast your [diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5778/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram?p=netframework) object to this type, in order to access its specific options.
